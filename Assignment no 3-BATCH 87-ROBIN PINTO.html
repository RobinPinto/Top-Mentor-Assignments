# math.sqrt()
# math.pow()
# math.pi
# math.e
# math.sin(x)
# math.cos(x)

2.How is the random module used in Python? 

#The random module is used in the way as shown below:

import random
r = random.random()
print(r)

import random

r = random.randint(1,10)
print(r)

3.What are methods and functions in Python?

#A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. 
#It can take input (arguments) and return an output (return value). 
#Functions are designed to be reusable, making your code more modular and organized. 
#Functions can be defined using the def keyword.
#example:
def add(a,b):
    print(a+b)
add(2,2)

#A method,is a function that is associated with an object and is called using dot notation. 
#Methods are specific to the type of object they are called on, and they often operate on the internal data of that object. 
#For example, methods can modify the state of an object or retrieve information from it.
#Example:
#In this example, count() is a method of the string object text, and it's used to count the occurrences 
#of the letter 'R' in the string.
text = "Robin"
length = text.count('R')  
print(length)            


4.Explain the concept of exception handling in Python.

#the concept of exception handling can be explained via an example as below:
#it is basically useful when you want error free execution and running of program

try:
    (2+"2")
except:
    print("Integer and string cannot be added")

5.How can you print multiple lines of "Hello World" using print statements?

#method1

print("Hello World\n" * 3)

#method2

print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")

#method3

print("""Hello World
Hello World
Hello World""")

6.What error occurs when you try to divide a number by zero (4/0)?

print(4/0)

 7.How can you handle the division by zero error using a try-except block? 

try:
    print(4/0)
except:
    print("you cannot divide a number by zero")

8.Explain the purpose of the SyntaxError and provide an example. 

#syntax error occurs when a particular order of code as defined in python is not followed
#example:

a=5
if a==5
    print("everything is fine")
else:
    print("everything is not fine")

#as can be seen above the syntax of an if else statement requires a colon in front of both if and else.
#since the colon is not there it is giving a syntax error.

9.How can you handle a ValueError in Python? 

#By using try and except blocks as below:
try:
    value = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

10.Provide an example of using multiple except blocks for different types of errors.

try:
    2 + "2"
except IndexError as e:
    print("Trying to access the index which is not in list..")
except TypeError as e:
    print("You cannot add string and integer.",e)

11.Describe a situation where you might use the finally block. 

try:
    print("2+2")
except:
    print("Cannot add string and integer")
else:
    print("Nothing went wrong")
finally:
    print("file closed.")

12.What is the purpose of the as keyword in the context of exceptions?

#In the context of exceptions, the as keyword is used in Python to assign the exception instance to a variable. 
#This allows information about the exception that occurred, such as its type and any additional data associated with it. 
#The as keyword is typically used within the except block to capture the exception instance.
#Example:
try:
    2 + "2"
except IndexError as e:
    print("Trying to access the index which is not in list..")
except TypeError as e:
    print("You cannot add string and integer.",e)


13. Explain the concept of multidimensional arrays in Python.

#In Python, a multidimensional array is a data structure that can store values in a tabular format with multiple dimensions. 
#Example:2-dimensional array
import numpy
res = numpy.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5]])
print(res.ndim)


14.How can you install the numpy library using the command line /jupyter? 

!pip install numpy

15. How do you uninstall a package, such as numpy, using the command line /Jupyter ? 

!pip uninstall numpy

16. How can you rename a library/module using the as keyword? 

#Example:
import math as m
result = m.sqrt(25)  
print(result)

17.Describe what the numpy library is used for.

# 1. It is Python Library
# 2. Stands for Numerical Python
# 3. It Deals with numbers and data.
# 4. We can perform mathematical operations easily
# 5. It is much faster as compared to list
# 6. It handles very large Datasets
# 7. It support array till ndarray(n-dimensinal)

18. Explain the difference between a list and a NumPy array. 

import numpy as np
arr=np.array(
    [[1,1,1,1]]
)
print(arr+2)

arr=[1,1,1,1]
print(arr+2)

#as shown above numpy is fast and better with large data sets as compared to lists
#list can be used for general programming whereas numpy arrays may be used for complex programming.

19.How can you create a one-dimensional array in NumPy?

import numpy as np
res=np.array([2])
print(res.ndim)

20. What is the ndim attribute of a NumPy array used for?

#it is used to confirm the if the array is in 1d,2d or 3d.

21.How can you create a two-dimensional array in NumPy?

import numpy as np
res=np.array([[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]])
print(res)
print(res.ndim)

22. Explain the difference between arr[0][2] and arr[0, 2].

import numpy as np
arr=np.array([[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]])
print(arr[0][2])

import numpy as np
res=np.array([2,3,4,5])
print(arr[0,2])

#they are the same.

23. Provide examples of arithmetic operations on a NumPy array.

import numpy as np
arr=np.array(
    [[3,1,5,6]]
)

print(arr-2)
print(arr*2)

24.How can you calculate the sum, maximum, and mean of a NumPy array? 

import numpy as np
arr=np.array(
    [
        [25,36,49,4],
        [100,66,99,10]]
)
print(np.sum(arr))
print(np.max(arr))
print(np.mean(arr))

25.What is the purpose of the np.sqrt() function in NumPy? 

#to calculate square root of array elements

import numpy as np
arr=np.array(
    [
        [25,36,49,4],
        [100,66,99,10]]
)
print(np.sqrt(arr))


26. How can you filter elements in a NumPy array using a condition?

#example:
import numpy as np
arr=np.array(
    [
        [1,10,2,1],
        [5,4,3,2]]
)
print(arr[arr>=5])

27.How can you use the np.concatenate() function to combine arrays? 

import numpy as np

arr1=np.array(
    [
        [1,10,2,1],
        [5,4,3,2]]
)

arr2=np.array(
    [
        [100,210,32,11],
        [15,14,13,12]]
)
print(np.concatenate((arr1,arr2)))

28.Explain the concept of reshaping an array in NumPy. 

#Reshaping an array in NumPy refers to changing the arrangement of elements in an array while keeping the total number of elements constant.
#Essentially, you are changing the dimensions or shape of the array without altering the data itself. 

 29.Provide an example of using the reshape() function in NumPy.

import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6])

res = np.reshape(arr1,(2,3))

print(res)

30.How can you access specific elements of a two-dimensional NumPy array? 

# print 2,3,4 from second element of 2D

import numpy as np
arr=np.array(
    [[5,6,7,8],
     [1,2,3,4]]
)
print(arr[1,1:4])


31. What is the shape attribute of a NumPy array used for? 

#The shape attribute of a NumPy array is used to determine the dimensions of the array. 
#It provides a tuple of integers that represent the size of the array along each dimension.
#example:
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]])

shape_tuple = arr.shape
print(shape_tuple) 

32. How does the shape attribute differ from the ndim attribute? 

#shape Attribute:

#The shape attribute of a NumPy array returns a tuple of integers that represent the size of the array along each dimension.
#It provides the dimensions of the array in terms of the number of elements along each axis

#ndim Attribute:

#The ndim attribute of a NumPy array returns an integer representing the number of dimensions (axes) in the array.
#It provides a quick way to determine the dimensionality of the array without explicitly looking at the shape tuple.

33.How can you create a pie chart using the matplotlib library? 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

expenses = np.array([100,200,5000,1000])
categories = ["Travelling","Food","Staying","Saving"]
color = ["Blue","yellow","green","black"]

plt.pie(expenses,labels=categories,colors=color)
plt.show()

34.What is the purpose of the labels and colors parameters in plt.pie()?

#The labels parameter is used to provide labels for each sector of the pie chart. 
#These labels usually correspond to the categories or segments that the chart represents.

#The colors parameter is used to specify the colors of the sectors in the pie chart.
#You can provide a sequence of color values (strings, RGB tuples, etc.) that correspond to the colors of each sector in the same order as the data.

35.Provide an example of accessing specific elements of a three-dimensional NumPy 
array.

import numpy as np
array_3d = np.array([[[ 1,  2,  3,  4],
                      [ 5,  6,  7,  8],
                      [ 9, 10, 11, 12]],

                     [[13, 14, 15, 16],
                      [17, 18, 19, 20],
                      [21, 22, 23, 24]]])

## ADLC

* Answer should be here:

1.SQL is often credited to Dr. Edgar F. Codd, a British computer scientist.

2.SQL was first developed in the early 1970s.

3.The first version of SQL was developed by IBM.

4.The original name of SQL was not "SQL" but rather "SEQUEL," which stood for "Structured English Query Language." It was later shortened to SQL due to trademark issues.

5.SQL was influenced by a language called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), developed by IBM. However, SEQUEL had to be renamed to SQL due to trademark conflicts.

6.The first commercial implementation of SQL, IBM System R, was released in the 1970s.

7.The initial purpose of SQL when it was created was to provide a standard and user-friendly language for querying and manipulating data stored in relational databases.

8.Some of the early versions of SQL were called SQL-86, SQL-87, and SQL-89, which corresponded to the years in which they were proposed as standards.

9.SQL started to become a standard in the 1980s.

10.SQL has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

11.SQL was first standardized by ANSI in 1986, and the ISO standardization followed in 1987.

12.The three major categories of SQL statements are:

a.Data Query Language (DQL): Used for querying data from a database (e.g., SELECT statements).

b.Data Definition Language (DDL): Used for defining and managing the structure of database objects (e.g., CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE).

c.Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used for manipulating data in the database (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

13.The primary motivation behind creating SQL was to provide a standardized and user-friendly way to interact with relational databases.

14.SQL has evolved over the years to include new features, improved performance optimizations, enhanced security, and support for various data types and operations.


15.Some key features introduced in SQL-92 (ANSI SQL 1992) include support for joins, subqueries, and the CASE expression, as well as enhancements to the CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements.

16.IBM played a significant role in the development of SQL by creating the first commercially available relational database system with SQL support, IBM System R, and by contributing to the early development and standardization of SQL.

17.SQL started gaining popularity outside of academia and research in the late 1970s and 1980s as commercial relational database management systems with SQL capabilities became available.

18.SQL differed from other query languages of its time by offering a standardized and user-friendly way to interact with relational databases. It provided a declarative approach to querying data, allowing users to specify what data they wanted without specifying how to retrieve it

19.Some of the early contributors to the development of SQL included Donald D. Chamberlin, Raymond F. Boyce (IBM), and Dr. Edgar F. Codd, among others.

20.Some notable SQL-based database management systems that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s include IBM System R, Oracle, Ingres, and Informix, all of which played a significant role in popularizing SQL as a database query language
